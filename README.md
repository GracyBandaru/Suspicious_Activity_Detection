# Suspicious Activity Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect suspicious activities in video footage using a **CNN-LSTM model**. The model is trained to classify video frames into different categories of suspicious activities (e.g., shoplifting, abuse, etc.). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.

## Features
- **Video Preprocessing**: Extracts frames from videos and resizes them for model input.
- **CNN-LSTM Model**: Combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance.
- **Prediction**: Allows users to classify new videos using the trained model.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GracyBandaru/Suspicious_Activity_Detection.git
   cd Suspicious_Activity_Detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
   Place your dataset in the `dataset` folder. The dataset should contain videos organized by class (e.g., Abuse, Shoplifting).

## Usage

### 1. Preprocessing
To preprocess the dataset (extract frames and resize them):
```bash
python preprocess.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --output_path /path/to/output
```

### 2. Training
To train the CNN-LSTM model:
```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/preprocessed_data --model_path /path/to/save_model
```

### 3. Evaluation
To evaluate the model on the test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --test_data_path /path/to/test_data
```

### 4. Prediction
To classify a new video:
```bash
python predict.py --model_path /path/to/model --video_path /path/to/video
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **DCSASS Dataset**, which contains videos of various suspicious activities. The dataset is organized as follows:

```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ Abuse/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Abuse001.mp4
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Abuse002.mp4
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Shoplifting/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Shoplifting001.mp4
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Shoplifting002.mp4
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

- **CNN Layers**: For spatial feature extraction from video frames.
- **LSTM Layers**: For temporal modeling of frame sequences.
- **Dense Layers**: For classification.

```python
model = Sequential([
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu'), input_shape=(max_frames, img_size[0], img_size[1], 1)),
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')),
    TimeDistributed(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))),
    TimeDistributed(Flatten()),
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'),
])
```

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 97% on the test set.
